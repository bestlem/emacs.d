* TODO Tangle selectively

Make it so not all org files are tangles.
For projects this could be a .dir-locals.el file.
For others not all files.

* TODO Tangle add extra stepson
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       org_mark_mini20:20231209T162441.989003
:END:
For example set up the tangled file to be formatted by outside formatter - not just indet-region as now.

* TODO Nix

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Add macro use-package-non-elpa for the latter.

*** TODO Generate list of packages for nix.

As it has not been updated forget it.

As nearly all customization does not need to be saved and as aquamacs goes - then not needed.

Put it all in global map. Allows me to change these keys per mode. (and for treemacs ber buffer-local)
* DONE Spaces
CLOSED: [2020-01-19 Sun 22:18]
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Current babel code encodes files with spaces by http encoding so result is not the same as the start. I think that this is not required in tangle but that is a code change. Safest fix is to move init files but need to deal with customisation
I think newer org-mode fixes this.

* DONE Links

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
I tried to include all the org text in the source code but that adds extra links which seem to defeat detangle - but could be space related
