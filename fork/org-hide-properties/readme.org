* About

  A small hack to reduce clutter in my init file, but can be potentially used
  elsewhere too. It will hide tags in headings by changing their 'invisible'
  text property.

* Installation

  Either clone this repo or just download 'org-hide-properties.el'.

  Put org-hide-properties.el somewhere in Emacs load-path. From there you
  have option to either:

  M-x package-install-file RET org-hide-properties.el RET

  or just require file in your init file somewhere.

* Requirements

Really none, should be compatible with Emacs 22.1 but package.el does not
  recognize requirements older than Emacs 24.1, it is satt to that one.

* Usage

M-x org-hide-properties-mode to turn it on/off.
  
* Issues

Let me know.

* Screenshots

* License

  GPL v3. For details, see the atached [[./LICENSE][license file]].
