* Completion
** Text
This is completion for text in buffer
*** Current program
This looks at the current code and prompts for variables etc
 I need something and company seems to be the current one
Add some from jweigley
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package company
   :ensure t
   :diminish
   :commands (company-mode company-indent-or-complete-common)

   :hook (after-init . global-company-mode)
   :config
   (define-key company-mode-map [tab]
     '(menu-item "maybe-company-expand" nil
                 :filter (lambda (&optional _)
                           (when (check-expansion)
                             #'company-complete-common))))
   )
#+end_src

*** Language dependant
This depends on the major mode and helps in code structure
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package yasnippet
  :ensure t
  :demand t                             ; need to force the load
:after company
  :config
  (yas-global-mode 1)
  (yas-load-directory (mwb-user-emacs-file "snippets"))
  (defun company-mode/backend-with-yas (backend)
    (if (and (listp backend) (member 'company-yasnippet backend))
        backend
      (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend))
              '(:with company-yasnippet))))

#+end_src
** Emacs
This is completion for emacs commands. Choice is ido, ivy helm.
I'll try ivy.
Note headers have tangle command in to suppress one or other
**** Find M-x commands
  This is [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Smex][smex]] buy ivy replaces it actually it uses it - Something changed :(
  #+begin_quote
  Smex is a M-x enhancement for Emacs. Built on top of IDO, it provides a convenient interface to your recently and most frequently used commands. And to all the other commands, too.
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
	(use-package smex
	  :ensure t
	  :config
	  (smex-initialize))
  #+end_src

*** Ivy
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mwb-init-load "init/ivy")
#+end_src
