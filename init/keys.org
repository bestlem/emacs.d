This file manages my global  key bindings except in Aquamacs they are not global.
Other files might have defined global keys e.g. to start particular modes,  but in general we want them here.

It is debateable wether we put bindings here or next to the functions

** How to bind
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       org_mark_2020-01-24T17-28-10+00-00_mini12:D8A384B2-3A02-4CDA-9A56-AC71DA2150F9
:END:
The obvious is global key but......Aquamacs has added a map or two mainly to provide the command keys e.g. ‚åòS so [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AquamacsFAQ#toc13][Aquamacs FAQ]]  suggest (define-key osx-key-mode-map (kbd "H-t") 'treemacs) to alter the OSX map.

This [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/27441815/151019][Stack Overlow answer]] suggests use of bind-key  if we do not want to be overridden.

Also see [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][General package]] but see [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el/issues/10][comparison]] with bind-key from use package so stick to bind.

I use mac-key-code for non Aquamacs Mac. I then noticed two issues A-s fails in Org src and the some keys randomly became odd chars.
e.g. A-c becomes ¬¢ well not exactly that . which-key shows the correct key. This required learning a lot of rubbish I can forget now. First is due to order of keymaps and second is iso-transl which messes the key translation..

There is a general idea as in the SO answer quoted above as to put your keys into a minor mode map that you can turn and off. Aquamacs comment for osx-map-mode suggests the same. But there is a mix here as I want to be able to override my keys.  As there is no real use of Alt key in Emacs it is an independent map (except for the iso-transl mess)

Aquamacs works with the A-s issue as it loads osx-mode-map early. I loaded mac-kep-map quite early but it is after org-mode so I can't override that key. In both cases visual-line-mode is loaded first then Aquamacs has tabbar and keyboard emulation and mac-key-mode has isearch and then outline and org modes. Note that Aquamacs does at start of osxkey-mode mess with isearch (ah does that affect swiper)

So quick hack is put mac-key-mode before org-mode, so has to be in config which is better than behaviour logically - and the org setup for keybindings is simple so does not need org mode.
*** Key representation

:END:
There is a difference between bind and general in how they report the bindings. general always puts the string through kbd bind does not. The difference is in getting the description. Aquamacs is patched to show the Apple key symbols but bind only shows them if the string is passed through kbd. This can be patched. However Aquamacs is not fully patched, if an of the key is in <> e.g. <f1> then it does not try to reformat the string.

I used Teletypes at some stage in the beginning or at least very clicky keyboards. My first professional and heavy programming was in APL so I am used to odd layouts (IBM 3279 although this [[https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Flive.staticflickr.com%2F1671%2F25859890091_f7e9173891_b.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2F22368471%40N04%2F25859890091&docid=ZLVoX24MY-4ACM&tbnid=ZUP2S6AC-ynJIM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwi32JONrMDmAhVOQhUIHV8UCAEQMwhOKAAwAA..i&w=1023&h=445&bih=872&biw=1298&q=apl%20keyboard&ved=0ahUKEwi32JONrMDmAhVOQhUIHV8UCAEQMwhOKAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8][one]] looks more like it) and clicky keys. My DOS editor was microemacs so learn some of the control xs xc and c-ae.

This is really the main piece of Emacs customization I have done over the years. I do not have full history before 2008 which is for Aquamacs and by that stage I had forgotten what all the key definitions were. The rcs log was from 2002 and that was 1.1.1.17 so quite a bit there but even that would have been a conversion to OSX, from my work using NT and Sun (Linux was all server) and a NeXT PC.

I then read about keyboards especially from Xah Lee and came across the [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/i/NeXT_adb_keyboard_87366.jpg][NeXT adb keyboard for Pizza Box NeXT]] which I then realised is what I used and was where I really started to use Emacs. Note the command key is a bar below space and the keys are Help Alt going out from the space. So I used command as a binding and Help.
These keys are what the \?H bindings were and I had forgotten and probably removed a lot of those as I did not understand them. I also forgot what use the <return> and C-m choices were for. See [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_key_notation_return_vs_RET.html][Xah Lee "<return>" and "RET"]]
 "<return>" is the Return key while emacs runs in a graphical user interface.
 "RET" is the Return key while emacs runs in a terminal.
 "RET" is also equivalent to "C-m" („ÄêCtrl+m„Äë). (For why, see: [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/keystroke_rep.html][Emacs's Key Syntax Explained]])

Muscle memory has a lot to answer for.
The first app that I which had useful function keys was Visual C (The IBM had it but most programming was on Micro APL and I forget what that was)
The latest MS [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-for-frequently-used-commands-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019][document]] lists them. f5 is the one I remember and that now does Debug.Start, which I think does a build then runs the debugger so that was my main hit and go key. Nowadays my usual task is build and run tests and debug only if needed. So I changed f5 some time ago. The debug steps are f10 and f11 but can't see a continue, I include f12 there. f8 is Edit.GoToNextLocation so fits with my next error. But the NeXT suggestion looks like f7 and 8 (well equivalent) so the next error got shifted.

Following Xah Lee's comments and seeing [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/space-cadet_keyboard.html][The Space Cadet Keyboard]] which is what emacs was implemented on and they keys outwards of space are control, Meta, Special and Hyper. So I tried binding so it went control, meta, super and caps lock as hyper but I am too used to the Apple binding so went back to Command, Meta and control with caps lock as hyper (and right Windows key). However the control key is difficult to hit.

I can't touch type but seem to have two modes. One is two or more finger for text. Then a mode switch to alter things where I have a right hand on the mouse and left with thumb on ‚åò, little finger near caps lock, next on a etc. Thus ‚åòzxcvasd are easy most of those are Apple keys, similarly the alt versions are OK but emacs does use that. The control ones are difficult. The Hyper ones are OK.
I discovered [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra Mode]] which allows you to define keys and a menu to show what they do. I realised that for a new to me mode I could bind the most interesting functions to a hydra to help me learn what the mode does and also cut down on control-C (That's interrupt, isn't it ü§£must bind control-C to control-G as I have wanted that for ages)

So hyper-A is now a mode hydra key and I have started defining a hydra on that,
And as per Yah Lee it might be better to not use chords - ie two key presses e.g.  A-s so I have started implementinmg a leader hydra so that I can make caps-lock a real key not hyper.

We have fn available so have it as hyper and then use Karabiner  (try iCue later) to map Caps Lock and Window key to hyper. Super is used sometimes so I think is confusing and as noted sequence of keys (emacs key-chord and hydra) is better.
I don't use the right hand modifier keys so not set separately.
Things got changed on one run so set here and remove from customisation

This inbuilt emacs package provides bindings for odd characters using a C-x 8 map - but it also biunds them to Alt key which wrechis things like A-C which is now ¬¢

Aquamacs patched iso-transl.el so it is now a mode and can be turned on and off.

I am not the only one to suffer see [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/17508/9874][Emacs SX question]] and also [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/61415/9874][my question]]

Note that you can control what the screen displays A for Alt or ‚å•. Emacs is not that clever and looks at what it is told and not what appears on the key but I am back to the normal bindings so does not matter. Although hydra seems to object, now fixed. Set the value to non=nil to use Mac symbols.

Runs the current buffer through a compiler or interpreter. There are also functions to do for a method. Includes C, Racket, Python, Julia. However all through a batch command so not into REPL and not really through make.
See https://github.com/syohex/emacs-quickrun but assumes a lot. Better look at org mode and repls.

This is a problem. I have used several mice with emacs. The best is the old 3 button Sun mouse or Logitech trackball, this makes mouse-2 easy to use. However we now have scroll wheels so mouse-2 is uncomfortable and not easy to control.
macOS has its own standards so mouse-3 does its own thing.
There are several things we want mouse-3 to do:
1. If on a word and it is misspelt then show alternatives and ability to save.
2. If on a region show cut and paste, other actions on a region
3. Thing at point (if region or not) search for region or word in google
4. Show menus from main menu - e.g. mode specific and imenu.

Aquamacs has the best support. But it hacks flyspell heavily mainly to get macOS dictionary (the main benefit of Aquamacs) but also to show the corrections etc. Then it adds to the flyspell menu the rest of cut and past, google etc.  help:flyspell-emacs-popup and help:aquamacs-popup-context-menu
Emacs has a couple of maps mouse3-noregion-popup-entries etc
mac-key-mode has a simple one [[help:mac-key-context-menu]]
mouse3+ has a more complex setup including if selected a region or not see help:mouse3-popup-menu

I think start with Aquamacs copy using non Aquamacs functions and then try to put flyspell on.

Replace Hyper key combination with a leader key - eventually this will be caps lock

As this has to be a leader map so no hydra H-s is the issue as in some org-mode maps then mighty be better to use which-key-add-keymap-based-replacements to set pretty names for which key
