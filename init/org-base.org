#+TITLE Emacs configuration org Mode - minimal load
#+PROPERTY:header-args :cache yes :tangle yes :comments link
#+STARTUP: content
* Base setup
This is so the file can be processed by nullman's expand - basically no noweb weaving.

*** Force load of new version
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/319#issuecomment-471274348][mzuther  fix]] to load via package as otherwise loads from emacs. However first attempt dec 2019 seemed not to be needed but leave here.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(assq-delete-all 'org package--builtins)
 #+end_src

*** Do the load from package.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

*** Do the complex bit
This file is the only one that using noweb weaving so must be loaded via a proper org babel

Now get the rest which can be expanded by org.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(mwb-init-load "init/org-all")
#+end_src
