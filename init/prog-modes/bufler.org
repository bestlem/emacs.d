Well the grouping is simpler than ibuffer but took me half a day to understand. You need to repeat directories in the group that filters and then again in the dir command and. You also need an else case otherwise buffers just get tacked onto the end of the list when they are different to the last header.
Found it - in the top group for special which is a negation - there is ~auto-file~ which gets ll files but then as gets negated this is all non file backed buffers.

I don't use ibuffer much - the main is to find unsaved buffers. bufler does not have a filter so can't be done. (Although I suppose I could switch bufler-groups but no predicate for dirty buffer) - the bufler notes.org says that variables should be buffer local to allow multiple bufler buffers - which means I could create another view on a different key.

Also my iBuffer closes certain groups - I now see that is copied extra code so an extension to both.
Bufler hack
1) Have a list of strings that begin groups.
2) Search for string at beginning of line.
3) Use ~magit-section-hide~ on ~(magit-current-section)~

Also work seems to have stopped the author is doing a sort but that branch is Oct 2021
