Which is wrong you need delete-process as quit-process won't kill if processis owned by shell
For a more singing and dancing version see https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgLangEmacs/comments/4x698w/one_command_to_kill_sml_restart_it_guess_and_load/
but on next read only the killing using comint functions seems better"

*** REPL
Hmm prob OK for the code, but my tests ar a large thing not one expr + you need to send the ; separately
