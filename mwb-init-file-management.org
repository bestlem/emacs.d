#+TITLE Emacs configuration - file management
#+PROPERTY:header-args :results output :session :cache yes :tangle yes :comments org :exports both
#+STARTUP: content

* TODO Trash
MacOs needs specific trash management not just mv to ~/.Trash
Perhaps only if in dired or other user controlled file
See [[https://github.com/lunaryorn/osx-trash.el][osx-trash]] but might need to find /opt/local/bin/trash
Or better patch Aquamacs to have this C code - perhaps done?
Need also to exclude some files - basically only iof you edit them
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
#+end_src

* TODO Compressed files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Transparently open compressed files
(auto-compression-mode t)

;; Old commented out code - need to review

;;  --- uncompress *.Z and *.gz files when visiting ---
;;
;; (autoload 'uncompress-while-visiting "uncompress"
;;   "Temporary \"major mode\" used for .Z and .gz files, to uncompress them.")
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;; 	  (cons '("\\.Z$" . uncompress-while-visiting) auto-mode-alist))
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;; 	  (cons '("\\.gz$" . uncompress-while-visiting) auto-mode-alist))
;; (setq auto-mode-alist

* Backups
Literate programming suggests each setq should be in a separate block - see later but EOL comment changes where closing parenthesis is maybe better copy code iif we had a macro to do this.
This set of variables is from [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ForceBackups][Emacs Wiki - Force Backup]] but that is not the best explanation. The version numbers are explained better elsewhere

Need to look in customisation as some things are easier to edit there . e,g, the list for where backup files are. Currently I do to the current directory/.~ which no one's init files seem to have but then found ity in Emacs manual: ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜³
The best inits I found for this were [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/auto-save-and-backup-every-save/][Pragmatic Emacs]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][developer of use package]]  which build on [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ForceBackup][Emacs Wiki Force Backups]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq
 backup-by-copying t     ;  Copy all files, don't rename them and don't clobber symlinks
 kept-new-versions 10    ; keep 10 latest versions
 kept-old-versions 0     ; don't bother with old versions
 delete-old-versions t   ; don't ask about deleting old versions
 version-control t       ; number backups
 vc-make-backup-files t) ; backup version controlled files

#+end_src
** DO the backups
Aquamacs seems to turn this off sometimes in customization so need to investigate more
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (setq make-backup-files t)
 #+end_src
*** Backup on save
 Emacs is odd backups are started when loaded in a session and then not again (I suppose that is what auto save is for) but really we want a copy taken when saved as well.
 All the logs are very clever but what I want is the version number to increase so just see [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/9452080/151019][this SO answer]] I have modified it so that only saves on m,ac save ie when you manually save - possibly not good on emacs exit.
 Note need to change
 Filters are interesting for other reasons
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (defun mwb/mac-key-save-buffer-force-backup ()
   (interactive)
   "Save buffer. If needed, select file by dialog"
   (if buffer-file-name
	   (save-buffer 16)
	 (mac-key-save-file-as)))

 (define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap mac-key-save-file]  'mwb/mac-key-save-buffer-force-backup)
 #+end_src

** TODO Recent Files
 Should be a customise but Aquamets sets it so keeps adding to it pr does it need to check
 Exclusion regexes from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3g468d/stop_recent_files_showing_elpa_packages/][reddit]]
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ;; Problem is this is set after the recent files are set https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48784/recent-files-in-aquamacs

Started as file management but actually deals with files and what is in them/ Treemacs looks at git so there are files that cannot be see so dired needed.
