Declare an Emacs package by specifying a group of configuration options.

For full documentation, please see the README file that came with
this file.  Usage:

  (use-package package-name
     [:keyword [option]]...)

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:after           Delay the use-package declaration until after the named modules
                 have loaded. Once load, it will be as though the use-package
                 declaration (without `:after') had been seen at that moment.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `customize-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.

Jump to a project's files using completion based on context in other frame.

With a prefix arg INVALIDATE-CACHE invalidates the cache first.

If point is on a filename, Projectile first tries to search for that
file in project:

- If it finds just a file, it switches to that file instantly.  This works even
if the filename is incomplete, but there's only a single file in the current project
that matches the filename at point.  For example, if there's only a single file named
\"projectile/projectile.el\" but the current filename is \"projectile/proj\" (incomplete),
`projectile-find-file-dwim-other-frame' still switches to \"projectile/projectile.el\"
immediately because this is the only filename that matches.

- If it finds a list of files, the list is displayed for selecting.  A list of
files is displayed when a filename appears more than one in the project or the
filename at point is a prefix of more than two files in a project.  For example,
if `projectile-find-file-dwim-other-frame' is executed on a filepath like \"projectile/\", it lists
the content of that directory.  If it is executed on a partial filename
like \"projectile/a\", a list of files with character 'a' in that directory
is presented.

- If it finds nothing, display a list of all files in project for selecting.

Create a Hydra - a family of functions with prefix NAME.

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions
defined here.

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

Pop up a posframe and show STRING at POSITION.

\(1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

\(2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.
The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
10. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'

by the way, poshandler can be used by other packages easily
\(for example: mini-frame) with the help of function
`posframe-poshandler-argbuilder'. like:

   (let* ((info (posframe-poshandler-argbuilder child-frame))
          (posn (posframe-poshandler-window-center info)))
     `((left . ,(car posn))
       (top . ,(cdr posn))))

\(3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: 'info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in 'info'.

\(4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example ' *mybuffer*', so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and list-buffers.

\(5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

\(6) WIDTH, MIN-WIDTH, HEIGHT and MIN-HEIGHT

WIDTH, MIN-WIDTH, HEIGHT and MIN-HEIGHT, specify bounds on the
new total size of posframe.  MIN-HEIGHT and MIN-WIDTH default to
the values of ‘window-min-height’ and ‘window-min-width’
respectively.  These arguments are specified in the canonical
character width and height of posframe.

\(7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

\(8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

\(9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

\(10) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

\(11) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

\(12) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

\(13) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

\(14) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

\(15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

\(16) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

\(17) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

\(18) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other appliction
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

\(19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

This is a minor mode meant for those who do not care about treemacs' workspace
features, or its preference to work with multiple projects simultaneously.  When
enabled it will function as an automated version of
`treemacs-display-current-project-exclusively', making sure that, after a small
idle delay, the current project, and *only* the current project, is displayed in
treemacs.

The project detection is based on the current buffer, and will try to determine
the project using the following methods, in the order they are listed:

- the current projectile.el project, if `treemacs-projectile' is installed
- the current project.el project
- the current `default-directory'

The update will only happen when treemacs is in the foreground, meaning a
treemacs window must exist in the current scope.

This mode requires at least Emacs version 27 since it relies on
`window-buffer-change-functions' and `window-selection-change-functions'.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when

This acts as more fine-grained alternative to `treemacs-follow-mode' and will
thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation.  When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appearance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does.

These bindings may be added when `after-init-hook' is run.
Each binding is added if and only if at that time no other key
is bound to the same command and no other command is bound to
the same key.  In other words we try to avoid adding bindings
that are unnecessary, as well as bindings that conflict with
other bindings.

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'
is called to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their
init file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit'
is loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that
all the potentially conflicting user bindings have already
been added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Setting this variable to nil has no effect if that is done after
the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to
`magit-file-dispatch'.  The former is a much better binding
but the \"C-c <letter>\" namespace is strictly reserved for
users; preventing Magit from using it by default.

hydra heads.  Each head has exactly the same syntax as that of
`defhydra', except hint is required for the head to appear in the
docstring.  The following additional options are supported:

  - `:width' the max width of a dynamic hint, used to calculate
    the final width of the entire column.  It is ignored when the
    hint is a string.

  - `:toggle' when specified, it makes the head a toggle and adds
    an indicator to the end of the hint for the status of the
    toggle.  The value of this option can be a symbol, an s-exp
    or t.  The toggle status is read from the given variable, by
    evaluating the given expression or checking the `cmd' as if
    it's a variable.  The latter is especially useful for minior
    modes, e.g.

       (\"n\" `linum-mode' \"line number\" :toggle t)

Toggle Iedit mode.
This command behaves differently, depending on the mark, point,
prefix argument and variable `iedit-transient-mark-sensitive'.

If Iedit mode is off, turn Iedit mode on.

When Iedit mode is turned on, all the occurrences of the current
region in the buffer (possibly narrowed) or a region are
highlighted.  If one occurrence is modified, the change are
propagated to all other occurrences simultaneously.

If region is not active, `iedit-default-occurrence' is called to
get an occurrence candidate, according to the thing at point.  It
might be url, email address, markup tag or current symbol(or
word).

In the above two situations, with digit prefix argument 0, only
occurrences in current function are matched.  This is good for
renaming refactoring in programming.

You can also switch to Iedit mode from isearch mode directly. The
current search string is used as occurrence.  All occurrences of
the current search string are highlighted.

With an universal prefix argument, the occurrence when Iedit mode
is turned off last time in current buffer is used as occurrence.
This is intended to recover last Iedit mode which is turned off.
If region active, Iedit mode is limited within the current
region.

With repeated universal prefix argument, the occurrence when
Iedit mode is turned off last time (might be in other buffer) is
used as occurrence.  If region active, Iedit mode is limited
within the current region.

With digital prefix argument 1, Iedit mode is limited on the
current symbol or the active region, which means just one
instance is highlighted.  This behavior serves as a start point
of incremental selection work flow.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, Iedit mode is
restricted in the region, e.g. the occurrences outside of the
region is excluded.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, with an universal
