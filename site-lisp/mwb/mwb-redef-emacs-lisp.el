  "This function is the normal value of the variable `lisp-indent-function'.
The function `calculate-lisp-indent' calls this to determine
if the arguments of a Lisp function call should be indented specially.
INDENT-POINT is the position at which the line being indented begins.
Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.
If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function that has a non-nil
property `variable lisp-indent-function' (or the deprecated `lisp-indent-hook'),
it specifies how to indent.  The property value can be:
* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style
  \(this is also the case if there is no property and the function
  has a name that begins with \"def\", and three or more arguments);
* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
  (like ordinary function arguments), and then indent any further
  arguments like a body;
* a function to call that returns the indentation (or nil).
  `function lisp-indent-function' calls this function with the same two
  arguments that it itself received.
This function returns either the indentation to use, or nil if the
Lisp function does not specify a special indentation."
